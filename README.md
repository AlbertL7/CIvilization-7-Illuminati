 # Illuminati Civilization - Civilization VII Mod

  *"The world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes."*

  Step into the shadows and lead a civilization built on secrecy, influence, and hidden power. The Illuminati don't conquer through brute force—they control through information, gold, and carefully placed agents.

  ## Installation

  ### Prerequisites

  You may need to install the **Civ Mods Manager** to enable mod support for Civilization VII. Download it from the official site:

  🔗 **[https://civmods.com/](https://civmods.com/)**

  Follow the instructions on the site to set up mod support for your game.

  ---

  ### Step 1: Download the Mod

  - Click the green **Code** button at the top of this repository
  - Select **Download ZIP**
  - Extract the ZIP file to a location of your choice

  Alternatively, clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AlbertL7/CIvilization-7-Illuminati.git

  Step 2: Locate Your Civ VII Mods Folder

  Navigate to your Civilization VII installation folder:
  C:\Users\<Your UserName>\AppData\Local\Firaxis Games\Sid Meier's Civilization VII\Mods

  Can't find it?
  - The AppData folder is hidden by default. In File Explorer, click View → Show → Hidden items
  - Alternatively, press Win + R, type %localappdata% and press Enter, then navigate to Firaxis Games\Sid Meier's Civilization VII
  - Or simply search for Firaxis Games in File Explorer

  No Mods folder?
  If the Mods folder doesn't exist, create it manually.

  Step 3: Install the Mod

  Important: Place the illuminati_civ folder directly into the Mods folder.

  Copy the illuminati_civ folder (the one containing Illuminati.modinfo) into your Mods folder.

  Your folder structure should look exactly like this:
  Sid Meier's Civilization VII/
  └── Mods/
      └── illuminati_civ/
          ├── config/
          ├── data/
          ├── icons/
          ├── text/
          └── Illuminati.modinfo

  ⚠️ Common Mistake: Do not place the entire repository folder in Mods. The illuminati_civ folder must be directly inside the Mods folder, not nested in another folder.

  ❌ Wrong: Mods/CIvilization-7-Illuminati-main/illuminati_civ/
  ✅ Correct: Mods/illuminati_civ/

  Step 4: Enable the Mod

  1. Launch Civilization VII
  2. From the main menu, navigate to Additional Content → Add-Ons
  3. Find Illuminati Civilization in the list
  4. Make sure it is set to Enabled

  Don't see the mod? Double-check that:
  - The illuminati_civ folder is directly in the Mods folder
  - The folder contains the Illuminati.modinfo file
  - You have the Civ Mods Manager installed from https://civmods.com/

  Step 5: Play

  Start a new game, select your leader, and embrace the shadows!
